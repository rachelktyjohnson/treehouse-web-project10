# Treehouse WebDev Project 10
## Build a SQL Library Manager

You have been tasked with creating an application for your local library to help them manage their book collections. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. The application you create should provide a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, you will build a web application that will include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. We'll provide you HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This project provides a great opportunity to start familiarizing yourself with implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence and leveraging helpful database-related tools to view and interact with your database.

After completing this project, you'll be able to add true data persistence in your projects and implement, modify, interact with and maintain your own local custom SQLite database. You will also have a powerful new skill to add to your resume.
